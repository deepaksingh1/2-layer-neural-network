  Using sum-of-square error as loss function.
  Using Sigmoid activation function.

# Data
User Modeling Dataset. 
The dataset contains 403 samples and 5 attributes. 
All attributes refer to the knowledge level of user weather it is low, medium or high.

Attribute Information:
1. STG (The degree of study time for goal object materails),
2. SCG (The degree of repetition number of user for goal object materails)
3. STR (The degree of study time of user for related objects with goal object)
4. LPR (The exam performance of user for related objects with goal object)
5. PEG (The exam performance of user for goal objects)
6. UNS (The knowledge level of user): Low, Medium, High
